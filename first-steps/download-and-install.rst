Download and install
--------------------

|PhaserEditor|_ is built with web technologies and you can run it in your desktop or in the cloud (see |PlayPhaserEditor|_).

To run it in your desktop or private server, you have to download the binaries for your platform:

`Download Phaser Editor 2D for desktop <https://phasereditor2d.com/downloads>`_

You don't need to install the IDE, just un-compress the downloaded file and run the server:

In Windows, open the command prompt and run:

.. code::

 > PhaserEditor2D.exe -desktop

In macOS and Linux, open the terminal and run:

.. code::

 $ ./PhaserEditor2D -desktop


The server should start and open the default browser in the address: ``http://127.0.0.1:1959/editor``.

The projects will be stored in your home folder, in the ``PhaserEditor2D_Projects`` folder.

If you want to code in JavaScript inside the IDE, then we recommend to `enable the advanced JavaScript tools <../code-editor/js-editor-advanced-features.html>`_.
