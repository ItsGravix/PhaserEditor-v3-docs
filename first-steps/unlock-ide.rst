Unlock the IDE
--------------

By default, the IDE runs in a Free mode. This mode includes all the IDE features, but limits the number of files per project to 70. If you need to create bigger projects, you have to unlock the IDE.

To unlock the IDE:

1. Purchase a license key in the `Phaser Editor 2D Gumroad page <https://gumroad.com/l/phasereditor/>`_. That key is valid for all the IDE versions. If you have a valid license key from a previous version (v1 or v2) then you don't need to purchase a new one.

2. Open the terminal of your OS and write the command:

  .. code::

    > PhaserEditor2D.exe -lickey <license key>
