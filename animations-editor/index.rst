Animations Editor
-----------------

In Phaser_, you can configure the sprite animations in a separated JSON file. Phaser Editor v2 provides a tool to create Phaser_ animations files, but it is not ready yet for Phaser Editor v2. However, you have these alternatives:

* Configure the animations by hand, using the Phaser_ API methods.

* Download Phaser Editor v2 and `create the animation file <https://phasereditor2d.com/docs/v2/animations-editor.html>`_. It is a huge download.

* Use `Animator <https://gammafp.com/tool/animator/>`_, a free, third-party online tool made by `gammafp <https://twitter.com/gammafp/>`_.
