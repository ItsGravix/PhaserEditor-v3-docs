Importing files from the Files view
-----------------------------------

Importing the files from the |FilesView|_ is very similar to how you add the files from the |BlocksView|_, but it does not need to open the |AssetPackEditor|_.

No matter the editor is active, you can select a file (or multiple files) in the |FilesView|_ and, in the **Asset Pack File** section of the |InspectorView|_, select the option to import the file into an existent |AssetPackFile|_ or a new one.

If the file you selected in the |FilesView|_ is already present in an |AssetPackFile|_, then the |InspectorView|_ shows a button to open that |AssetPackFile|_, in the |AssetPackEditor|_.
