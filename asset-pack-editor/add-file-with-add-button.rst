#. When you select a file type, it opens a dialog with a list of files selected following rules. Select the files you want to import.

 * The files belong to the folder, or sub-folder, of the Pack File. It is not a restriction of the Pack Files, but we use it to simplify the process of import the files. 

 * The content type or extension of the files are compatible with the type selected. For example, if you select to add an Image, then only image files are shown.

 * Files that are not used by any pack file in the project are highlighted (in bold).
