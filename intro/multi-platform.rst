Available for multiple platforms
--------------------------------

|PhaserEditor|_ v3, like the general of web applications, has two layers, the back-end (or server) and the front-end (or client).

At this moment, we have different back-end implementations, one for the desktop or private networks (for a single user), and other for the cloud, that allows multiple users.

The back-ends are closed (no source available to the public) and are commercial.

The front-end is the same for all back-ends. It is the most important and bigger part of the IDE. It is open source, has a MIT license and we welcome any collaboration on it. It is hosted on GitHub and is the main place to request features or report bugs.

Desktop and private networks back-end
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The back-end for desktop and private network is a small native program available for all the main platforms: Windows, macOS and Linux. It is the main product we offer to the community. You can download it from our website and run it in your desktop or your private server.

By the way, this back-end is especially friendly with remote containers and third-party tools like |vscode|_ . We should write an article about it.

Cloud back-end: Play Phaser Editor 2D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The back-end for the cloud is not available for download, it is hosted in our own cloud: |PlayPhaserEditor|_. It is a small service dedicated mainly to show the IDE features. It has two tiers: the **Premium** tier for Phaser Editor License owners and the **Free** tier for any registered user.

In the future, we should implement a more flexible service with a range of options to allow better management of the storage, the users and groups, the integration with third-party services, the game publishing and a marketplace for art assets and game components, between others.
