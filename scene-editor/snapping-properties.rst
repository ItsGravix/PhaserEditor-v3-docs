Snapping properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The snapping properties allow to divide the scene in a grid and place the objects in the cells of the grid. This is a very useful technique to keep the objects properly aligned.

* **Enabled property**: activates the snapping. You can change the value in the |InspectorView|_ with the ``E`` key.

* **Snapping Width and Height**: is the size of the grid to snap the objects. You can change it in the |InspectorView|_. Also, you can select an object and execute the **Snap To Object Size** command.

Context menu
````````````

The context menu of the scene shows the **Snapping** sub-menu with the snapping commands:

* Toggle Snapping (``E``).

* Snap To Object Size (``W``). This command takes the size of the selected object and set it as the snapping size values of the scene.
