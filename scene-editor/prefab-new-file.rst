Creating a prefab file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A prefab_ is a scene file that you can create with the `New File dialog <../workbench/new-file-dialog>`_. In the dialog, select the **Prefab File** option. It opens the **New Prefab** dialog, where you can choose the parent folder and the name for the new prefab_ file. That name will be used to generate the class name of the prefab_, so let's write a valid class name.

Look the prefab_ file is just a scene file. When it is created, it is empty, you should create an object that will be `the prefab object <prefab-object.html>`_.
