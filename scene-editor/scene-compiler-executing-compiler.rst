Executing the compiler
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


You have multiple options to compile a scene file:

* When you save the modifications of a scene file in the |SceneEditor|_ the scene is compiled automatically.

* In the context menu of the |SceneEditor|_ you can click on the **Compile Scene** command.

* The **Compile Scenes** command compiles all the scene files of the project. You can execute the command with the ``Ctrl+Alt+B`` keys. It is also available in the |MainMenu|_ and the `FilesView context menu <../workbench/files-view.html#context-menu>`_.
