Adding an object to the scene
-----------------------------

.. toctree::

    add-object-dialog
    blocks-view-integration
    add-object-automatic-container

There are multiple ways to add objects to the scene:

* Opening the `Add Object dialog <add-object-dialog.html>`_.
* By `dropping an asset from the Blocks view <blocks-view-integration.html>`_.
* By pasting an object (including those from other scenes).

Following a `set of rules <add-object-automatic-container.html>`_, the editor determines (or create) the parent for the new object.
