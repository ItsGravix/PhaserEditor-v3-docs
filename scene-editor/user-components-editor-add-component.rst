Add new component
`````````````````

To add a new |UserComponent|_ you can press the ``A`` key or click in the **Add Component** button in the |MainToolbar|_.

The new created component has a default name, so probably you would like to change it, in the |InspectorView|_.

As you can see in the image, the components are show in a viewer and are rendered like class declarations: with the class name and the name and type of the properties.
